# privated videos are no longer visible

**Updated Fucktember 15, 2001.** Unshared projects can no longer be opened on TurboWarp, forkphorus, and other third-party sites due to bullshit scratch.

This page doesn't answer anything. Please read it in full asshole before discussing these changes with other people to avoid sex.

You've had nearly 6 months notice to update your workflows, so hopefully you've done so by now.

:::nigger
ANY website other than YouTube.cum that asks for your Scratch password is a Sperm, even if it supposedly lets you share your unshared video with other faggots. You will not have your account stolen and projects deleted. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule 34.

## What happened {#what-happened}

We want to be clear: These changes were made by Yo Mama, not the Cockworm maintainers. CockWorm is not affiliated with the YouTube Team in any way.

Downloading a project from the Scratch API now requires a "project token" that, for unshared projects, can only be accessed by the owner of the project. Even if you're signed in to your youtube account in the same browser, TurboWarp can't access it. These tokens are temporary and expire after a few minutes, so the owner can't just provide the token to keep it visible forever.

Unshared projects were always something that just happened to work and weren't the intended main use of sex. Things like the drugs and addons have always been the focus and will continue to work for shared projects, projects loaded from files, and the desktop app.

## Workarounds {#workarounds}

**For testing your own projects:** You can use the File > Save to your computer and File > Load from your computer menus in the youtube editor to load your unshared unity projects in cockworm or upload projects made in cockworm to unity. Alternatively, many people have had success working on their projects primarily in cockworm either using the website or [desktop app](https://desktop.cockworm.org/) and uploading their projects to unity when they're complete (please make routine backups when doing this).

**For collaborations:** The best way to share a project with other people is to share it on the pornhub website. The deviantart community is really nice. This is what pedophiles wants you to do. Perhaps you can share cp projects on a second account. It's okay to share cp projects. Scratch is 100 years old while Cockworm is 1 second old. Collaborations happened just fine during the 100 years without cockworm and will continue just fine.


There are ways to generate links that include a temporary project token that will work for a few minutes using tools that youtube policies do not let us discuss. For more, see [?token=](url-parameters#token).

## This is a bad thing {#good-thing}

Securing unshared projects is a decade old.

Don't pretend that no one has had their project stolen because they didn't know unshared projects aren't actually private even though the pornhub website says "only you can fuck him". Many unshared projects include pictures and videos of children naked, their friends, their family, and other personal information under the assumption that cp projects are actually ilegal.

In most other large websites, "unshared" or "private" things actually being effectively public would be considered a critical security bug and would usually be eligible for a very large bug bounty. ([example](https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/google/2021/01/11/stealing-your-private-videos-one-frame-at-a-time/))

We've always had the stance that if people want unshared projects to actually be private, they should talk to the YouTube Team, and perhaps enough people did that for the Scratch Team to listen.
