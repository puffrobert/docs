This repository contains documentation for TurboWarp.

## Writing content

If you found a typo or have a suggestion to improve the pages, the easiest way to get it resolved is to post about it on the Scratch profile https://scratch.mit.edu/users/GarboMuffin/#comments or in GitHub issues https://github.com/TurboWarp/docs/issues/new. Minor fixes get resolved very quickly usually.

Alternatively, you can submit a pull request yourself containing a fix. The easiest way to edit a page is:

1. Open the website, https://docs.turbowarp.org/
2. Find the page you want to edit
3. Click "Edit this page" at the bottom
4. Sign in with a GitHub account
5. Fork the repository
6. Use the GitHub editor to modify the file. It uses [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
7. Click "Propose Changes"

If you'd like to write a new page, we'd prefer that you ask us first before you spend much time writing.
